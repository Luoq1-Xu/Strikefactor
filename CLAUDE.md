# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

StrikeFactor is a pygame-based baseball batting simulator where players face off against AI-controlled pitchers with realistic pitch physics and timing mechanics. The game features multiple elite pitchers, each with unique pitch arsenals and AI behavior patterns.

## Running the Game

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the game
python strikefactor/main.py
```

The game uses Python 3.12+ and pygame-ce for the core rendering and game loop.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Game Loop
The main game is managed by the `Game` class in [main.py](strikefactor/main.py), which orchestrates:
- **GameStateManager** ([game_state_manager.py](strikefactor/gameplay/game_state_manager.py)): Manages transitions between game states (menu, gameplay, summary, visualization, etc.)
- **PitcherManager**: Handles pitcher instances and their AI counterparts
- **AssetManager**: Loads and caches game sprites and assets
- **UIManager** ([ui_manager.py](strikefactor/ui/ui_manager.py)): Manages all pygame_gui UI elements
- **SoundManager** ([sound_manager.py](strikefactor/engine/sound_manager.py)): Handles audio playback
- **ChallengeManager** ([challenge_manager.py](strikefactor/gameplay/challenge_manager.py)): Tracks ABS challenges remaining per side
- **BatterProfile** ([batter_profile.py](strikefactor/ai/batter_profile.py)): In-session player swing tendencies, read by pitch-selection AI
- **HUDs**: `Scorebug`, `BroadcastHUD`, `MinimalHUD` — see [HUD System](#hud-system)
- **PitchDatabaseService** (singleton, [pitch_database.py](strikefactor/data/pitch_database.py)): SQLite logging of every pitch

### Game States
The game uses a state machine pattern with states defined in [game_states.py](strikefactor/gameplay/game_states.py):

**Main Menu Flow:**
- **ModeSelectState**: Top-level mode selection (Arcade/Sandbox/GameDay) with typing effect animation
- **MenuState**: Arcade mode — pitcher selection, settings, and key bindings
- **SandboxMenuState**: Sandbox pitcher selection (typing effect)
- **GameDayState**: Entry screen for full 9-inning GameDay mode, uses `PitcherCarousel` to pick the opponent starter

**Gameplay States:**
- **GameplayState**: Active batting gameplay (Arcade + GameDay share this state)
- **SandboxGameplayState**: Sandbox batting — user controls pitch selection via on-screen pitch buttons (`update_sandbox_pitch_buttons`) and accumulates "laps" (see [Sandbox Mode](#sandbox-mode))
- **SummaryState**: Post-game statistics
- **VisualizationState**: Pitch trajectory animation playback
- **ViewPitchesState**: Review all pitch locations with PitchViz
- **InningEndState**: End-of-inning transition (before summary)
- **GameDayTransitionState**: Manages flow between innings in GameDay mode (relief decisions, opponent at-bats, box score)

**Navigation Flow:**
```
ModeSelectState (game start)
    ├── ARCADE  → MenuState (pitcher selection) ──→ GameplayState
    ├── GAMEDAY → GameDayState (carousel pick) ──→ GameplayState ⇄ GameDayTransitionState
    └── SANDBOX → SandboxMenuState ──→ SandboxGameplayState
```

Each state extends the abstract `GameState` class and implements `enter()`, `exit()`, `update()`, `handle_event()`, and `render()` methods.

### Pitcher System
Pitchers are defined in [strikefactor/pitchers/](strikefactor/pitchers/):
- **Base class**: [pitcher.py](strikefactor/pitchers/pitcher.py) - Defines core pitcher functionality, stats tracking, and pitch arsenal management
- **Concrete pitchers**: Sale.py, Degrom.py, Mcclanahan.py, Yamamoto.py, Sasaki.py
- Each pitcher defines their pitch types as methods that call the simulation with specific physics parameters (acceleration, velocity, travel time)
- Pitch types are registered via `add_pitch_type(function, name)` in the pitcher's `__init__`

### AI System
The AI uses Q-learning for pitch selection:
- **ERAI class** ([AI_2.py](strikefactor/ai/AI_2.py)): Implements epsilon-greedy Q-learning
- Pre-trained models stored as pickle files in [strikefactor/ai/](strikefactor/ai/) (e.g., `sale_ai.pkl`, `degrom_ai.pkl`)
- Each pitcher has an attached AI that learns pitch selection based on game state (count, outs, runners on base, previous pitch)
- The AI chooses actions using `choose_action(state)` which balances exploration (epsilon) vs exploitation
- **BatterProfile** ([batter_profile.py](strikefactor/ai/batter_profile.py)): Tracks the live player's swing tendencies by zone quadrant (`up_in` / `up_away` / `down_in` / `down_away`), pitch type, count state, chase rate, and first-pitch rate. The pitch-selection AI consults this profile to exploit patterns. Profiles are persisted per `(mode, difficulty)` bucket via `PitchDatabaseService.{load,save}_batter_profile` so behavior carries across sessions.

### Pitch Physics & Simulation
The pitch simulation is handled by [pitch_simulation.py](strikefactor/gameplay/pitch_simulation.py):
- **PitchSimulation class**: Manages the entire pitch sequence from windup to contact/miss
- Physics parameters: `ax`, `ay` (acceleration), `vx`, `vy` (velocity), `traveltime`
- Ball position tracked in 3D: `[x, y, z]` where z is distance from plate
- Collision detection uses physics utilities from [utils/physics.py](strikefactor/utils/physics.py)
- An AI umpire model (`ai_umpire.pkl`) determines ball/strike calls

### Hit Outcome System
[hit_outcome_manager.py](strikefactor/gameplay/hit_outcome_manager.py) determines hit results:
- Factors: swing timing, swing location (high/low relative to ball), contact quality
- Difficulty modifiers affect out probabilities and hit outcomes
- Separate logic for contact swings (W key) vs power swings (E key)
- Outcomes: SINGLE, DOUBLE, TRIPLE, HOME RUN, FLYOUT, GROUNDOUT, LINEOUT, FOUL BALL
- Once an outcome is resolved, `pitch_simulation._start_hit_animation()` hands off rendering to [HitAnimation](#hit-animation), which classifies the trajectory shape and plays it before the result banner appears.

### Hit Animation
[hit_animation.py](strikefactor/gameplay/hit_animation.py) renders a top-down ball-flight animation between hit resolution and the outcome banner:
- **HitAnimation class**: Geometric primitives only (no sprite assets). Three motion layers:
  - **Trajectory shape**: `GROUNDER` / `LINER` / `FLY` / `POP_UP`, chosen by `_pick_shape()` from the outcome plus the swing's vertical offset (outs are deterministic; hits are weighted-random per outcome).
  - **Fielders**: All 9 defenders visible (`Fielder` class), with per-outcome primary/backup assignments moving toward the play; idle sway keeps them alive at rest. Defaults in `FIELDER_HOMES`.
  - **HR distance overlay**: Quality-driven ~365–485 ft readout once the ball clears the wall.
- Field geometry uses anisotropic feet→pixel projection (`FT_TO_PX_X = 1.85`, `FT_TO_PX_Y = 1.10`) anchored to `HOME = (640, 670)` to mimic MLB Gameday's wide, y-foreshortened look.
- `HitAnimation.classified_outcome` is read back by `PitchSimulation` once the animation finishes — only then are score/runners updated and the outcome banner fired.

### ABS Challenge System
MLB-style automated ball-strike challenge after umpire calls:
- **ChallengeManager** ([challenge_manager.py](strikefactor/gameplay/challenge_manager.py)): Tracks remaining challenges per side (default `CHALLENGES_PER_SIDE` from `config.py`). Successful challenges are retained, failed ones decrement. `set_unlimited(True)` is used in Sandbox to make challenges free.
- **ABSChallengeOverlay** ([abs_challenge_overlay.py](strikefactor/ui/abs_challenge_overlay.py)): Phased replay overlay — intro card (`_PHASE_INTRO_END`) → 2D trajectory replay (`_PHASE_REPLAY_END`) → camera zoom (`_PHASE_ZOOM_END`) → CALL CONFIRMED/OVERTURNED banner.
- Enabled per-game by the `abs_enabled` setting; reset/configured around state transitions in `main.py` (`challenge_manager.reset_all()`, `set_unlimited()`).
- Triggered through the challenge keybind; routes through `Game._on_abs_challenge_*` in [main.py](strikefactor/main.py) (~lines 1450–1500).

### HUD System
Three pluggable HUD renderers, selectable via the `hud_mode` setting and cycled at runtime by `Game.toggle_hud_mode()`:
- **Scorebug** ([scorebug.py](strikefactor/ui/scorebug.py)): Full-width TV-style bottom bar (`hud_mode = "legacy"`)
- **BroadcastHUD** ([broadcast_hud.py](strikefactor/ui/broadcast_hud.py)): Four-corner layout — count top-left, inning/score top-right, pitcher/last-pitch bottom-left, bases bottom-right (`hud_mode = "broadcast"`)
- **MinimalHUD** ([minimal_hud.py](strikefactor/ui/minimal_hud.py)): Compact bottom-right corner widget (`hud_mode = "minimal"`)
- All share a strict black/white/gray palette. `Game._render_hud()` dispatches to the active one; visibility toggles in sync with the global UI toggle.
- Keybinding: `TOGGLE_HUD_MODE` cycles modes during gameplay.

### GameDay Mode
Full 9-inning game simulation in [gameday_manager.py](strikefactor/gameplay/gameday_manager.py):
- **GameDayManager**: Owns inning/half state, opponent at-bat simulation, bullpen management, momentum/clutch bonuses, and event log.
- **PitcherStats**: Per-pitcher pitch count, outs recorded, fatigue label, and mistake/velocity/movement modifiers — used by both pitching sides.
- **Opponent at-bats**: `simulate_opponent_at_bat()` rolls outcomes using `_get_adjusted_probabilities()`, which factors in pitcher fatigue, momentum, and clutch.
- **Bullpen logic**: `should_consider_relief_pitcher()` / `substitute_relief_pitcher()` for the opponent; `should_consider_player_relief_pitcher()` / `_pick_player_reliever()` / `substitute_player_relief_pitcher()` for the player team. Roles, pitch caps, IP caps, and outcome multipliers are loaded from [data/pitcher_attributes.json](strikefactor/data/pitcher_attributes.json) via `get_pitcher_attrs(name)`.
- **Walk-off detection**: `check_walkoff()` ends the game immediately when the home team takes the lead in the bottom of the 9th or later.
- **Box score**: `get_box_score_lines()` feeds the [BoxScorePanel](strikefactor/ui/box_score_panel.py) rendered in the GameDay finale.
- **History**: Saved per-game to `data/gameday_history.json` via `save_game_result()`; class methods `get_career_record()` and `load_history_record_vs(pitcher)` power the pitcher-vs-record line on the [PitcherCarousel](strikefactor/ui/pitcher_carousel.py).

### Sandbox Mode
Free-practice mode where the player picks every pitch:
- **SandboxGameplayState** ([game_states.py](strikefactor/gameplay/game_states.py)): Wires the active pitcher's arsenal to on-screen pitch buttons (`UIManager.update_sandbox_pitch_buttons`) so the player chooses what gets thrown next.
- Challenges are unlimited in Sandbox (`challenge_manager.set_unlimited(True)`).
- **Lap system**: A "lap" is a self-contained practice run with a count of at-bats and pitch-by-pitch results. Lap history is persisted to `data/lap_history.json` and viewed in-game through [LapLogPanel](strikefactor/ui/lap_log_panel.py).
- **RandomScenarioGenerator** ([random_scenario.py](strikefactor/gameplay/random_scenario.py)): Produces themed starting states (clutch, two-strike, full count, bases loaded, etc.) for variety inside Sandbox.

### Settings & Configuration
- **SettingsManager** ([settings_manager.py](strikefactor/settings_manager.py)): Persists user settings to `settings.json`
  - `difficulty`: ROOKIE to HALL_OF_FAME
  - `umpire_sound`, `master_volume`
  - `display_mode`, `display_fps`, `engine_fps`
  - `batter_handedness`, `show_strikezone`
  - `abs_enabled`: Toggles the ABS challenge feature
  - `hud_mode`: `"legacy"` / `"broadcast"` / `"minimal"` — see [HUD System](#hud-system)
- **KeyBindingManager** ([key_binding_manager.py](strikefactor/key_binding_manager.py)): Manages customizable key bindings saved to `key_bindings.json`
  - Default actions: toggle UI (H), strikezone (Z), sound (M), quick pitch (SPACE), view pitches (V), toggle HUD mode, main menu (ESC)
- **config.py**: Global constants (screen size, FPS, strike zone dimensions, physics constants, ABS colors/zone, `CHALLENGES_PER_SIDE`)

### Data & Analytics
- **ScoreKeeper** ([helpers.py](strikefactor/helpers.py)): Tracks game state (outs, runners, score)
- **PitchDataManager** ([helpers.py](strikefactor/helpers.py)): In-memory pitch record used for the per-game PitchViz / VisualizationState
- **batting_stats.json** ([strikefactor/data/](strikefactor/data/)): Historical batting performance for heatmap visualization (legacy aggregate JSON, `batting_stats_legacy_v1.json` is the prior schema)
- **PitchDB / PitchDatabaseService** ([pitch_database.py](strikefactor/data/pitch_database.py)): SQLite-backed persistent pitch log at `strikefactor/data/strikefactor.db`.
  - Tables: `pitches` (full 9-parameter kinematics, derived speed/movement, AB context, outcomes, ABS truth-vs-call), `pitch_trajectories` (20-sample 3D trajectory per pitch), `at_bats`, `games` (one row per Arcade encounter / GameDay / Sandbox session), `batter_profiles` (persisted [BatterProfile](#ai-system) aggregates keyed by mode+difficulty).
  - `PitchDatabaseService` is a singleton (`PitchDatabaseService.get_instance()`) with `start_game()` / `end_game()` / `record_pitch()` / `load_batter_profile()` / `save_batter_profile()`. Migrations are versioned by `SCHEMA_VERSION` and run in `PitchDB._migrate()`; an auto-backup runs into `data/backups/`.
- **Analytics scripts** (repo root, run outside the game):
  - [pitch_analysis.py](pitch_analysis.py): Generates visualizations from `strikefactor.db` (filterable by mode + difficulty). Output goes to `analysis_output/`.
  - [batting_analysis.py](batting_analysis.py): Player batting-tendency visualizations from the same DB.

## Key Dependencies

## Important Patterns

### Adding a New Pitcher
1. Create a new file in [strikefactor/pitchers/](strikefactor/pitchers/) inheriting from `Pitcher`
2. Define pitch methods with physics parameters (ax, ay, vx, vy, travel_time, pitch_type)
3. Register pitches in `__init__` using `add_pitch_type()`
4. Implement `draw_pitcher()` for animation timing
5. Load sprites via `load_img(loadfunc, sprite_path, frame_count)`
6. Import and add to PitcherManager in [main.py](strikefactor/main.py)
7. Train an AI model and save as `{pitcher_name}_ai.pkl` in [strikefactor/ai/](strikefactor/ai/)

### Adding a New Game State
1. Create a class in [game_states.py](strikefactor/gameplay/game_states.py) extending `GameState`
2. Implement all abstract methods: `enter()`, `exit()`, `update()`, `handle_event()`, `render()`
3. Register the state in `GameStateManager._initialize_states()` in [game_state_manager.py](strikefactor/gameplay/game_state_manager.py)
4. Add transition logic in `GameStateManager.handle_menu_state_change()` if needed
5. Add a button visibility state in `UIManager.set_button_visibility()` in [ui_manager.py](strikefactor/ui/ui_manager.py)
6. Register button callbacks in `Game._setup_ui_callbacks()` in [main.py](strikefactor/main.py)

### Adding New UI Buttons
1. Add button definition in `UIManager._create_game_buttons()` in [ui_manager.py](strikefactor/ui/ui_manager.py)
2. Add visibility logic in `UIManager.set_button_visibility()` for relevant states
3. Register callback in `Game._setup_ui_callbacks()` in [main.py](strikefactor/main.py)
4. Buttons automatically inherit styling from [theme.json](strikefactor/assets/theme.json)

### Modifying Swing Mechanics
- Swing detection logic is in [pitch_simulation.py](strikefactor/gameplay/pitch_simulation.py) (W/E key handlers)
- Contact detection uses `collision()` or `collision_angled()` from [utils/physics.py](strikefactor/utils/physics.py)
- Hit outcome calculation is in [hit_outcome_manager.py](strikefactor/gameplay/hit_outcome_manager.py)
- Hit animation handoff is in `PitchSimulation._start_hit_animation()`; trajectory shape is picked in `hit_animation._pick_shape()`
- Timing windows and bat radius defined in [config.py](strikefactor/config.py)

### Adding a Field to the Pitch Database
1. Add the column to the `CREATE TABLE` string in `PitchDB.SCHEMA` in [pitch_database.py](strikefactor/data/pitch_database.py)
2. Bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` and add an `ALTER TABLE` branch in `PitchDB._migrate()` (an auto-backup runs before any migration)
3. Populate the field in `PitchDataExtractor.extract_pitch_record()` from `PitchSimulation` state
4. Add the column to the `INSERT` statement in `PitchDB.insert_pitch()`

### Adding a HUD Mode
1. Create a new HUD class in [strikefactor/ui/](strikefactor/ui/) following the `Scorebug` / `BroadcastHUD` / `MinimalHUD` pattern (palette, screen size constants, `draw(screen)` method)
2. Instantiate it on `Game` in `Game.__init__` ([main.py](strikefactor/main.py))
3. Add the mode string to `SettingsManager.cycle_hud_mode()` and the dispatch in `Game._render_hud()`
4. The `TOGGLE_HUD_MODE` keybind will pick it up automatically once it's in the cycle list

## Working with Assets
- Asset paths are resolved via `get_path()` and `resource_path()` from [config.py](strikefactor/config.py)
- `get_path()`: For development, joins paths from SCRIPT_DIR
- `resource_path()`: For PyInstaller builds, uses `sys._MEIPASS`
- Pitcher sprites stored in [assets/images/{pitcher_name}/](strikefactor/assets/images/)
- Ball sprites in [assets/images/ball/](strikefactor/assets/images/)
