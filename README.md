# âš¾ StrikeFactor

A pygame baseball batting simulator that puts you in the batter's box against some elite pitchers. Easy to start up and quickly jump into the action. Face off against AI-controlled pitchers with realistic pitch physics precise timing mechanics

## ðŸŽ® Getting Started

### Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python strikefactor/main_refactored.py
```

### How to Play
1. **Choose your opponent** - Select which pitcher you want to face
2. **Watch the pitch** - Follow the ball as it flies toward home plate
3. **Time your swing** - Move your mouse cursor to where you think the ball will be
4. **Make contact** - Press **W** for a contact swing or **E** for a power swing at just the right moment

The key is timing and positioning - swing too early or too late, and you'll miss. Power swings have a smaller window of contact (meaning you have to time up the pitch more accurately) but have a higher chance of getting better hit outcomes. Contact swings are the opposite - easier to make contact and get a hit, but weaker outcomes.
