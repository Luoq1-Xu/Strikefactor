# âš¾ StrikeFactor

A baseball batting simulator that puts you in the batter's box against some of the game's toughest pitchers. Face off against elite AI-controlled pitchers with realistic pitch physics and precise timing mechanics.

## ðŸŽ® Getting Started

### Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### How to Play
1. **Choose your opponent** - Select which pitcher you want to face
2. **Watch the pitch** - Follow the ball as it flies toward home plate
3. **Time your swing** - Move your mouse cursor to where you think the ball will be
4. **Make contact** - Press **W** for a contact swing or **E** for a power swing at just the right moment
